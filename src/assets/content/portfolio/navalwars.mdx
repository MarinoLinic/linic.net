## Naval Wars - Next.js Travian [2022]
**Technologies: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Prisma, Tailwind, Next-Auth**
<br/>
I worked on this experiment with a good friend of mine, [Kalciphoz](https://github.com/Kalciphoz), who created a successful [Terraria mod: KRPG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QldqCHEaqCc&feature=youtu.be). We were both just getting into web development, and decided to embark on creating a Travian clone in Next.js to learn frontend web dev.
<br/>
We created a login system via OAuth 2.0, a backend in Prisma with an SQL database, and a character selection screen. The project was deemed too ambitious, and Kalciphoz wanted to focus on his other interests whereas I needed to focus on finishing my university degree. 
<br/>
I learned a substantial amount about React and Next via this project. I was also taught some relevant coding principles by Kalciphoz, because there were files where my code was way more of a mess than it should have been.

The most difficult part was getting the backend to work and creating a good database model. At this time, I am unable to showcase communication with the database, but I can show one of the frontend elements that would have interacted with the backend: the character selection screen. It's quite shabby, but the proof of concept was thrilling back when this was my first working fullstack application. The user could select up to 10 characters and they would be saved to their profile.
