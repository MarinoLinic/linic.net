## Naval Wars - Next.js Travian [2022]
Technologies: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Prisma, Tailwind, Next-Auth
<br/>
I worked on this experiment with a good friend of mine, [Kalciphoz](https://github.com/Kalciphoz), who created a successful [Terraria mod: KRPG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QldqCHEaqCc&feature=youtu.be). We were both just getting into web development, and decided to embark on creating a Travian clone in Next.js to learn frontend web dev.
<br/>
We created a login system via OAuth 2.0, a backend in Prisma with an SQL database, and a character selection screen. The project was deemed too ambitious, and Kalciphoz wanted to focus on his other interests whereas I needed to focus on finishing my university degree. 
<br/>
I learned a substantial amount about React and Next via this project. I was also taught some relevant coding principles by Kalciphoz, because there were files where my code was way more of a mess than it should have been.
