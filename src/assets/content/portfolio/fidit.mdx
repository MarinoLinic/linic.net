## 2D Platformer - FIDIT Slayer [2023]
Technologies: JavaScript
<br/>
A funny (to my friends and I) full-fledged one-level platformer game [Dorian ManjariÄ‡](https://manjaric.com) and I made in pure JavaScript. It has a boss fight and everything, and we were making a lot of inside jokes about our university. I voice acted and made custom design for this, and created the main theme (music) using Omnisphere and FL Studio. [You can watch my own playthrough here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDLpS5BP7FU).
<br/>
We made this game with a lot of OOP principles in mind. I would often jump in if there was a persistent bug during development, so I made and fixed our collision detection system and a few other key elements of gameplay. Otherwise, I was more focused on designing the game and optimizing code.
