## Django Insect Museum [2023]
**Technologies: Django, Python**
<br/>
Along with [Ivan Matejčić](https://ivan-matejcic.netlify.app/), I created a functional CRUD application that lets the user manipulate entries in Django for a fictional
insect museum. Additionally, unit tests were created using django.test. Essentially, you can add or remove entries to indicate what specimens you have in your collection. It's a rudimentary application, however, with very few changes to the Django template.
<br/>
This was a good opportunity for me to learn using Django. And, the name? It was [my idea](https://linic.netlify.app/about).
