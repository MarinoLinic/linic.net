The website you're scrolling through is my attempt at designing my own portfolio and blog. Hopefully, you like it.
<br/>
Several mini projects are hosted: a portfolio blog, income tax calculator which visualizes distribution, and time counter using props. LocalStorage is used on homepage. I also have a few hidden mini tools I'm working on.
