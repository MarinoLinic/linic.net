## Income Tax Calculator [2023]
**Technologies: React, ReCharts, TypeScript, Tailwind**
<br/>
[Screenshot is outdated.] This is an ongoing project I made to calculate my taxes in Croatia. I've made sure to do some input sanitization, and explained and visualized how the law works step-by-step. I've also visualized how the taxpayer is affected in various ways. This is by far the most feature-rich tool for income tax in Croatia. (Which, admittedly, doesn't say too much!)
