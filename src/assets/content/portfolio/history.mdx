## Curated History of the World
<br/>
This project is not yet completed. It consists of displaying a large, main JSON file (accompanied by a few others to deal with categories) compiled from a CSV I personally filled with over 500 historical events and over a dozen attributes with the goal of making sense of world history in a particularly compressed manner.

Source code will be available <a href="https://github.com/MarinoLinic/curated-world-history">here</a>. In the meantime, you may see a very early [XLSX version](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fzc67WveqqNbZZohmLSg8ERfQ_rPP-YJSuce0c1j-uc/edit?usp=sharing) I uploaded online.
