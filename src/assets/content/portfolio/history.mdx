## Chronica Omnium â€” Curated History of the World [2023]
**Technologies: Vite, React, TypeScript, Python, CSS, Leaflet, Plotly**
<br/>
This project is not complete, and isn't intended for screen sizes below 2000 px in width; I also momentarily excluded events prior to 753 BCE. The project displays one large JSON file compiled from a CSV I personally filled with over 500 historical events (goal: 2000) and over a dozen attributes with the purpose of making sense of world history. By compressing and prioritizing events, I can allow people to more easily have a general picture they can use as a reference frame for memorizing whatever other piece of historical information they encounter afterwards. Context is immensely pertinent for being able to retain information within a field. 
<br/>
I used Python scripts for Wikipedia scraping and much of the logic of a would-be backend, as well as some recursive algorithms to add some columns based on existing data, and then used React to display all of the data.
<br/>
On the frontend side, I created features such as custom URLs (React Router's useParams hook), filtering options based on various attributes (you can see the options if you click on "Settings" on the page, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/P5Ie7qW.png">like so</a>), scrollbar page percentage counting, using props to send data to Plotly charts and Leaflet's maps, conditional showcasing, useState and useEffect hooks, and of course the existing CSS design.
<br/>
Even though development is on pause, I am excited about this tool, and intend to use and promote it as an educational resource in the future.
