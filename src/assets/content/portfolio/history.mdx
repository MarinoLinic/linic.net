## Chronica Omnium â€” Curated History of the World
<br/>
This project is not yet completed, and the CSS is not yet well-made for screens with a width below 2000 px; I also excluded events prior to 753 BCE for now from showing on the main page. It consists of displaying a large, main JSON file (accompanied by a few others to deal with categories) compiled from a CSV I personally filled with over 500 historical events and over a dozen attributes with the goal of making sense of world history in a particularly compressed manner. I used Python scripts for Wikipedia scraping and much of the logic of a would-be backend, as well as some recursive algorithms to add some columns based on existing data, and then used React to display all of the data.
<br/>
On the frontend side, I created features such as custom URLs (React Router's useParams hook), filtering options based on various attributes, scrollbar page percentage counting, using props to send data to Plotly charts and Leaflet's maps, conditional showcasing, useState and useEffect hooks, and of course the existing CSS design.
