### A Messenger Statistics Analyzer [2023]
Technologies: Python, Plotly, NumPy
<br/>
I export my Facebook messages and analyze character, message count, etc. 
Anybody can use this tool if they export their message data in JSON via official channels. 
This is from my university group chat.
Source code is [here](https://github.com/MarinoLinic/FB_Statistics_Analyzer/blob/master/main.py).

### A Discord Statistics Analyzer [2023]

I <i>love</i> data. I wanted to analyze what time of day I was sending most of the messages.
The lockdown gave me the opportunity to experiment with lifestyle and engage in risky exam procrastinationâ€”often writing during the night.
