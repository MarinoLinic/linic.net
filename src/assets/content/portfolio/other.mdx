## And Other Small Programs and Exercises...

<br/>
### A Showcase of p5.js Stuff [2023]
Technologies: p5.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
<br/>
It was fun engaging in creative programming with p5. 
Here are some of the things I've made. 
Try them [here](https://marinolinic.github.io/LinicPetranovic_p5/).

### A Messenger Statistics Analyzer [2023]
Technologies: Python, Plotly, NumPy
<br/>
I export my Facebook messages and analyze character, message count, etc. 
Anybody can use this tool if they export their message data in JSON via official channels. 
This is from my university group chat.
Source code is [here](https://github.com/MarinoLinic/FB_Statistics_Analyzer/blob/master/main.py).

<br/>
### A Discord Statistics Analyzer [2023]
Technologies: Python, Plotly, NumPy
<br/>
I did the same thing for my Discord university group chat.
The repository is [private](https://github.com/MarinoLinic/Discord_Statistics_Analyzer), however.
Additionally, there are no official channels to get this data from. 
I was using [this software](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter).

<br/>
I <i>love</i> data. I wanted to analyze what time of day I was sending most of the messages.
The lockdown gave me the opportunity to experiment with lifestyle and engage in risky exam procrastinationâ€”often writing during the night.

<br/>
There are more features, but I will come back to this project later and delve deeper, and then publish the repo.

### Simulating the Monty Hall Problem
Technologies: C++
<br/>
The [Monty Hall problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) wasn't entirely intuitive to me as a 19 year old.
So, I ran a simulation in C++ to confirm and understand probability.
[Source code is here](https://github.com/MarinoLinic/cpp-playground/blob/main/monty_hall.cpp).

### Not Liking an Emoji and Creating an Extension
Technologies: JavaScript
<br/>
This thing: ðŸ‘‹? I don't like it. 
If you want to remove it from your browser, install [my extension](https://github.com/MarinoLinic/hand-waving-emoji-blocker-extension)! 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
### Automating Browser Spam to Give My Friend's Chatbot Trouble
Technologies: Python, Selenium
<br/>
I thought there was no better way to play with Selenium than to test
my friend's infrastructure. [Here is how I did it](https://github.com/MarinoLinic/SeleniumTests/blob/main/Sigma.py)â€”and you can too, just by running this script.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
### And Python Scripts!
Technologies: Python
<br/>
I love making Python scripts to solve minor problems I encounter, and I love to save myself time.
