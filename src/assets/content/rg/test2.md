The **larynx** is one of the key organs involved in producing sound, principally the manipulation of pitch and
volume. The [etymology of the word](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BB%CE%AC%CF%81%CF%85%CE%B3%CE%BE) is
traced back to the Ancient Greek `λᾰ́ρῠγξ` (lárunx), meaning throat.

<br>

The **vocal folds** -- which, despite widespread usage, should _not_ be called vocal _cords_ -- are found in
the larynx.

<br>

The larynx is contained inside the **laryngeal skeleton**, which has nine cartilages. One of them is called
the **thyroid cartilage** -- you might have seen it externally if you ever noticed an
"[Adam's apple](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Adam%27s_apple_26.jpg/260px-Adam%27s_apple_26.jpg)",
which is, in fact, just a protrusion formed by the angle of the thyroid cartilage, hence named _laryngeal
prominence_.

<br>

The larynx is thus deeply connected to many other immediate structures and muscles which together help create
the intricacies of the human voice, and understanding it will help with the production of different types of
sounds necessary for singing in appropriate styles.
