My friend described 5 types of music (or 5 ways of listening to music):

<br>

**Dance music**  
The focus is on familiarity and being strongly rhythmic; basically music to dance to.

<br>

**Function music**  
Used for ceremonies and marches; it is not meant to draw attention per se, but it _is_ meant to make the occasion feel important.

<br>

**Florid music**  
Intricate, elaborate music that you listen to with full attention; the structure itself is complex enough that you _can_ listen to _just_ the music. These are arias, symphonies, intense duets, etc.

<br>

**Vibing music**  
Essentially chilling music, it is used to just exist in the background for whatever purpose.

<br>

**Escapist music**  
Music that encourages fantasy in whatever form; lots of film music might belong to this category.  

<br>

Most of the popular music we hear today is between dance and vibing music, neither of which is particularly impressive. Classical music and film soundtracks (the classical successor) are pretty much the primary examples of florid music.  

<br>

Some classical pieces or OSTs can be listened to as several of these. For instance, there have been times when I listened to Departure to the West from Joe Hisaishi intently and enjoyed the instruments (and I admit this type was most pleasurable); there have been times when I used it as background music (vibing), and there have been times when I used it to engage in some fantasy (maybe after watching the film or something). 

<br>

Anyway, the point isâ€”classical music is indeed superior on account of its complexity by what it can offer to the listener. If there are no "thoughts" running through your head while you're listening to it, you're probably doing it right. But a lot of people still use it as vibing music, like when they listen to some boring Mozart bs in the bg. There are also those who use it as escapist music, like when they status-signal (maybe that isn't even "listening" per se idk) or imagine living in some blissful 18th-century royal palace instead of actually paying attention to the piece. There are ways to get it wrong.  

<br>

I've listened to a lot of classical music, but in the end, I kinda just don't get it. Here and there I am able to appreciate the complexity, and those periods are intense and incredible, but in most cases, I just want melancholy and orchestral instruments to relax in some sense, and classical is too hectic for that. I wonder if that means I have worse taste. ðŸ˜›
