[{"id":1663020000,"title":"Types of Music (actual thing I wrote)\r","author":"Marino Liniƒá\r","date":"13 September 2022\r","content":"\r\nMy friend described 5 types of music (or 5 ways of listening to music):  \r\n\r\n**Dance music**  \r\nThe focus is on familiarity and being strongly rhythmic; basically music to dance to.\r\n\r\n**Function music**  \r\nUsed for ceremonies and marches; it is not meant to draw attention per se, but it _is_ meant to make the occasion feel important.\r\n\r\n**Florid music**  \r\nIntricate, elaborate music that you listen to with full attention; the structure itself is complex enough that you _can_ listen to _just_ the music. These are arias, symphonies, intense duets, etc.\r\n\r\n**Vibing music**  \r\nEssentially chilling music, it is used to just exist in the background for whatever purpose.\r\n\r\n**Escapist music**  \r\nMusic that encourages fantasy in whatever form; lots of film music might belong to this category.  \r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nMost of the popular music we hear today is between dance and vibing music, neither of which is particularly impressive. Classical music and film soundtracks (the classical successor) are pretty much the primary examples of florid music.  \r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nSome classical pieces or OSTs can be listened to as several of these. For instance, there have been times when I listened to Departure to the West from Joe Hisaishi intently and enjoyed the instruments (and I admit this type was most pleasurable); there have been times when I used it as background music (vibing), and there have been times when I used it to engage in some fantasy (maybe after watching the film or something). \r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nAnyway, the point is‚Äîclassical music is indeed superior on account of its complexity by what it can offer to the listener. If there are no \"thoughts\" running through your head while you're listening to it, you're probably doing it right. But a lot of people still use it as vibing music, like when they listen to some boring Mozart bs in the bg. There are also those who use it as escapist music, like when they status-signal (maybe that isn't even \"listening\" per se idk) or imagine living in some blissful 18th-century royal palace instead of actually paying attention to the piece. There are ways to get it wrong.  \r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nI've listened to a lot of classical music, but in the end, I kinda just don't get it. Here and there I am able to appreciate the complexity, and those periods are intense and incredible, but in most cases, I just want melancholy and orchestral instruments to relax in some sense, and classical is too hectic for that. I wonder if that means I have worse taste. üòõ\r\n"},{"id":1655244000,"title":"The Anatomy of the Larynx and Its Relation to Singing (actual thing I wrote 2)\r","author":"Marino Liniƒá\r","date":"15 June 2022\r","content":"\r\nThe **larynx** is one of the key organs involved in producing sound, principally the manipulation of pitch and\r\nvolume. The [etymology of the word](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BB%CE%AC%CF%81%CF%85%CE%B3%CE%BE) is\r\ntraced back to the Ancient Greek `Œª·æ∞ÃÅœÅ·ø†Œ≥Œæ` (l√°runx), meaning throat.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nThe **vocal folds** -- which, despite widespread usage, should _not_ be called vocal _cords_ -- are found in\r\nthe larynx.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nThe larynx is contained inside the **laryngeal skeleton**, which has nine cartilages. One of them is called\r\nthe **thyroid cartilage** -- you might have seen it externally if you ever noticed an\r\n\"[Adam's apple](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Adam%27s_apple_26.jpg/260px-Adam%27s_apple_26.jpg)\",\r\nwhich is, in fact, just a protrusion formed by the angle of the thyroid cartilage, hence named _laryngeal\r\nprominence_.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nThe larynx is thus deeply connected to many other immediate structures and muscles which together help create\r\nthe intricacies of the human voice, and understanding it will help with the production of different types of\r\nsounds necessary for singing in appropriate styles.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n![Larynx](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Larynx_external_en.svg)\r\n"}]
